This is a small repo for learning 2D game creation. When we know the basics we will create a new repo and start working on a real game. This repo will then be converted to a more generic base for new games. 

## Requirements ##

* Python 2.x (any version should work, only tested on 2.6 and 2.7 yet)
* [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html)
* [pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/)
* [PyYAML](http://www.pyyaml.org/)

## TODO ##
* Add things to this list
